        I am a passionate developer with a constant strive to dig myself deeper
        into the jungle of tech. I mostly do web development professionally and
        I don't like to limit myself to any specific technology or side of the
        stack. On my spare time I like to hit the gym, go on afterworks and
        spend time with my friends. If I get time to spare I tend to learn
        new languages and frameworks, my newest passion is
